The primary objective of the dashboard is to present key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide insights into the company's sales performance during the specified period. These KPIs include total sales revenue, sales revenue categorized by product category, total quantity sold per product category, sales revenue distributed across different cities, and total quantity sold in each city. The dashboard serves as a visual tool to facilitate data-driven decision-making and enable stakeholders to gain actionable insights into sales trends and performance metrics.
